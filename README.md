To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a scientific Python distribution. See Installing the SciPy Stack for details.

Many high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the NumPy Tutorial. We also recommend the SciPy Lecture Notes for a broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.

For more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the fundamental array data structure), see scipy.org.
